    "### üîç What is DistilBERT?  \n",
    "DistilBERT is a **lightweight, faster, and smaller** version of BERT, designed to maintain **97% of BERT‚Äôs performance** while being **60% faster** and using **40% fewer parameters**. It achieves this through a process called **knowledge distillation**, where it learns from a larger BERT model while retaining essential knowledge.  \n",
    "\n",
    "üöÄ **Why use DistilBERT?**  \n",
    "- **Faster Inference** ‚Äì Great for real-time applications!  \n",
    "- **Smaller Model Size** ‚Äì Ideal for deployment on edge devices.  \n",
    "- **Competitive Accuracy** ‚Äì Performs nearly as well as BERT on many NLP tasks.  \n",
